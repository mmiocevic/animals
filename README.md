- fixed logo on the left disappears
- header navigation goes to full width blocks with accordion functionality, "free interpretation"

### Note
- every assignment that starts with "advantage" is not mandatory
- every assignemnt that ends with "free interpretation", means you need to use your own judgement on how to achieve the specific task

# Author's note
Tested in:

- Firefox 73.0.1
- Chrome Version 80.0.3987.122
- Internet Explorer 11 v11.0.9600.17843
- Android 10

Due to time limit, design was not priority. It is not ugly but it can be better :) (at least what my eyes are telling me).

Also I intentionally left out ES6+ features. I am using const, let, arrow functions, generators, etc. on daily basis.

And finally, task was not mine and I did my best to finish it as best I could (also understanding it as best I could).

It was great practice after all.
